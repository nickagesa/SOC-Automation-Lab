# SOC-Automation-Lab

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) automation lab using open-source tools to streamline incident response and case management. The lab integrates Wazuh, Shuffle, and The Hive to detect and respond to security threats in real time.

### Objectives

-	Generate and analyze security alerts from endpoint activity.
-	Automate incident response workflows using Shuffle.
-	Manage incidents effectively through The Hive.
-	Perform real-time reputation checks with VirusTotal.
-	Implement defensive actions, such as blocking malicious IP addresses.


## Architecture

The lab architecture includes:
1.	Wazuh: Deployed to monitor endpoint activity and generate alerts.
2.	Shuffle: Configured for automation workflows and integration between components.
3.	The Hive: Set up for case management and detailed incident tracking.
